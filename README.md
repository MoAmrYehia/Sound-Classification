I created these two notebooks during [CodeVsCOVID19](https://codevscovid19.devpost.com/) as a proof of concept for our solution [DetectNow](https://www.detect-now.org/). 

## Inspiration 
Cough is one of the main symptoms of COVID-19 and based on the idea of cough analysis via AI, our project aims to find the unique biosignals of the COVID19 cough and calculate the probability of a SARS-CoV-2 infection. The whole process is available through a web application, making it easy, convenient, and accessible even in low-resource areas.

> DISCLAIMER: The diagnostics function is not live yet, as this will require a medical trial first.

> DISCLAIMER: As I cannot share the clinical data or the results, I retrain the model on public instruments data. 

## Dataset
I used Freesound General-Purpose Audio Tagging Challenge [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/freesound-audio-tagging) from Kaggle. 

## Notebooks
**FFT.ipynb**: a notbook where I cleaned the audio fils, appiled fft, and mfccs filter.

**CNN.ipynb**: a notebook where I reimplemented a CNN model that classify audio amound 10 different classes.
